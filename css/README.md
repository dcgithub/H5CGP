The CSS files in this directory were constructed from the HTML5 Boilerplate
project in 2013. They should still work fine, but you may want to investigate
whether you would prefer using the files from the current version of HTML5
Boilerplate instead, which are available at
https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/tree/master/dist/css.
If you do this, you should add the following style:

```css
canvas {
  -khtml-user-select: none;
  -moz-user-select: none;
  -ms-user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
  background-color: #FFFFFF; /* optional */
  border: 1px solid black; /* optional */
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0;
  user-select: none;
}
```
